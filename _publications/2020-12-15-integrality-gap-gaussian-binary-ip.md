excerpt: >-
    Motivated by a recent result of Dey, Dubey and Molinaro (SODA 2021),
    we prove an upper bound on the integrality gap of binary integer programs
    max <c,x> st Ax <= b, x in {0,1}^n with Gaussian distributed A and c.
    By an extension of DDM's result, we bound the size of the branch and bound
    tree necessary to solve such binary integer programs.
