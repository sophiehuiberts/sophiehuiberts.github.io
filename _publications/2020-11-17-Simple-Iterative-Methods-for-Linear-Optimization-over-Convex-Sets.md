excerpt: >-
  We give simple iterative methods for computing approximately optimal primal
  and dual solutions for the problem of maximizing a linear functional over a
  convex set K given by a separation oracle. In contrast to prior work, our
  algorithms directly output primal and dual solutions and avoid a common
  requirement of binary search on the objective value.
  Our methods are based on
  variants of the classical Von Neumann and Frank-Wolfe algorithms.



  Our algorithms are also easy to implement, and we provide an experimental
  evaluation of their performance on a testbed of maximum matching and stable set
  instances. We further compare variations of our method to the standard cut loop
  implemented using Gurobi.This comparison reveals that in terms of iteration
  count, our methods converge on average faster than the standard cut loop on our
  test set.
