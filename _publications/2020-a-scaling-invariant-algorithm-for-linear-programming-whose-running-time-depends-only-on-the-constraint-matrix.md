excerpt: >-
    The classical analysis of polynomial time LP solving results in iteration bounds depending on
    the bit complexity of the input data. Later work by Tardos and by Vavasis and Ye established
    bounds depending only on a certain condition number of the constraint matrix.


    We describe an algorithm whose running time instead depends on an arbitrarily much better (smaller)
    condition number of the constraint matrix, and give an analysis improving the dependence on
    the dimension of the problem. Moreover, we describe a novel approximation method
    for the involved condition numbers and find an algorithm to rescale the constraint matrix
