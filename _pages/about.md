I am currently a
[Simons Junior Fellow](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/simons-society-of-fellows)
at [Columbia University](https://theory.cs.columbia.edu/) in NYC.
Starting in October I will be a [CNRS researcher](https://www.cnrs.fr/en)
at [LIMOS](https://limos.fr/) in Clermont-Ferrand.
Previously, I did my PhD research at [Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica](https://www.cwi.nl)
in Amsterdam under [Daniel Dadush](https://homepages.cwi.nl/~dadush/) and received
my doctorate from the
[Mathematical Institute](https://www.uu.nl/en/organisation/mathematical-institute)
of Utrecht University.

I study practical algorithms for (mixed integer) linear programming.
These mathematical optimization tools are extensively used in industry and academia,
and my research focusses on explaining why these algorithms perform very well in practice,
much better than the theory of worst case analysis predicts.
Related to this, I am interested in geometric and combinatorial questions
about convex polyhedra.
For a short introduction to my work, check out my
[Rising Star talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-poynfWfTA)
which I gave during STOC 2021.

Besides research, I have made a browser plugin to use LaTeX on the chat website Slack.
It can be installed in
[Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/nl/firefox/addon/latex-in-slack/) or
[Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/latex-in-slack/pfcfelfnpbnboelkjedecjipaibpnfja),
and source code is available on
[Github](https://github.com/sophiehuiberts/katex-with-slack).
The plugin has over 3500 active users.
