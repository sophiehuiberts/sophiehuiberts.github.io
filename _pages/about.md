Sophie Huiberts is a PhD candidate at [Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica](https://www.cwi.nl)
and is advised by [Daniel Dadush](https://homepages.cwi.nl/~dadush/). She received
bachelor's degrees in mathematics and computer science and a master's degree in mathematics from Utrecht
University. She did her master's thesis research at CWI.

Her research focuses around algorithms for linear programming, with an interest in geometry and
probability in high dimensions.

She has worked on smoothed (probabilistic) analysis of the simplex method and on scaling-invariant
interior point methods.

Sophie wrote a browser plugin to use LaTeX on the chat website Slack.
It can be installed in [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/nl/firefox/addon/latex-in-slack/)
or [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/latex-in-slack/pfcfelfnpbnboelkjedecjipaibpnfja),
and source code is available on [Github](https://github.com/sophiehuiberts/katex-with-slack).
