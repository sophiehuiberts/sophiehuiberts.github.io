I am currently a [Simons Junior Fellow](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/simons-society-of-fellows/people/?appointed=2022&type=junior) at Columbia University in NYC.
Previously, I did my PhD research at [Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica](https://www.cwi.nl) in Amsterdam under [Daniel Dadush](https://homepages.cwi.nl/~dadush/) and received my doctorate from the [Mathematical Institute](https://www.uu.nl/en/organisation/mathematical-institute) of Utrecht University.

I study practical algorithms for (mixed integer) linear programming.
These mathematical optimization tools are extensively used in industry and academia,
and my research focusses on explaining why these algorithms
perform so much better in practice than in the theoretical worst case.
Related to this, I am interested in geometric and combinatorial questions
about convex polytopes.
For a short introduction to my work, check out my
[Rising Star talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-poynfWfTA)
which I gave during STOC 2021.

Besides research, I have made a browser plugin to use LaTeX on the chat website Slack.
It can be installed in [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/nl/firefox/addon/latex-in-slack/)
or [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/latex-in-slack/pfcfelfnpbnboelkjedecjipaibpnfja),
and source code is available on [Github](https://github.com/sophiehuiberts/katex-with-slack).
The plugin has over 3500 active users.
