I am currently a PhD candidate at [Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica](https://www.cwi.nl)
and advised by [Daniel Dadush](https://homepages.cwi.nl/~dadush/). I received my
bachelor's degrees in mathematics and computer science and a master's degree
in mathematics from Utrecht University.
Starting fall 2022, I am a Junior Fellow at the Simons Society of Fellows
and bringing my research to Columbia University.

I study practical algorithms for (mixed integer) linear programming.
These mathematical optimization tools are extensively used in industry and academia,
and my research focusses on explaining why these algorithms
perform so much better in practice than in the theoretical worst case.
A short introduction to my work can be found in my
[Rising Star talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-poynfWfTA)
during STOC 2021.

Besides research, I have made a browser plugin to use LaTeX on the chat website Slack.
It can be installed in [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/nl/firefox/addon/latex-in-slack/)
or [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/latex-in-slack/pfcfelfnpbnboelkjedecjipaibpnfja),
and source code is available on [Github](https://github.com/sophiehuiberts/katex-with-slack).
The plugin has over 3500 active users.
