I am currently a PhD candidate at [Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica](https://www.cwi.nl)
and advised by [Daniel Dadush](https://homepages.cwi.nl/~dadush/). I received my
bachelor's degrees in mathematics and computer science and a master's degree in mathematics from Utrecht
University. My master's thesis I wrote at CWI.

My research focuses around algorithms for (integer) linear programming, which I study
using tools from geometry and probability.

Besides research, I have made a browser plugin to use LaTeX on the chat website Slack.
It can be installed in [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/nl/firefox/addon/latex-in-slack/)
or [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/latex-in-slack/pfcfelfnpbnboelkjedecjipaibpnfja),
and source code is available on [Github](https://github.com/sophiehuiberts/katex-with-slack).
