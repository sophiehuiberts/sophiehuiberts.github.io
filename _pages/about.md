I am a PhD candidate at [CWI](https://www.cwi.nl) in
the Networks and Optimization group supervised by
[Daniel Dadush](https://homepages.cwi.nl/~dadush/).

My research interests are optimization algorithms
and geometry. In particular I work on linear
optimization and hope to bring theory and
practice closer together.
